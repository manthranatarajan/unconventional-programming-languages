# Racket Exercises Project

This project implements 10 exercises in the Racket programming language, demonstrating various functional programming concepts. Each function is implemented as described below:

1. **process-9**: A higher-order function that applies a given function to the integer 9.

2. **mymap**: A custom implementation of the `map` function using recursion to apply a given function to all elements of a list.

3. **second-min**: Finds the second smallest unique value in a list. Throws an error if fewer than two unique values exist.

4. **zipper**: Combines two lists into a list of pairs. Stops when the shorter list ends.

5. **classify**: Splits a list into two sublists based on a predicate: one where the predicate is true and another where it is false.

6. **member-n-times?**: Checks if an element appears exactly `n` times in a list.

7. **luhn**: Implements the Luhn algorithm to verify whether a number satisfies its checksum requirements.

8. **my-sorted?**: Verifies if a list is sorted according to a given comparison function.

9. **my-flatten**: Recursively flattens a nested list into a single-level list.

10. **my-list-ref**: Retrieves the element at a specific index in a list. Throws an error if the index is out of bounds.

Each function is designed to reinforce understanding of recursion, higher-order functions, and functional programming principles in Racket.
